## Lab 1: Customize this skill for your own Recipe

Open your Lambda function and click on the Code tab.  Review the first section of the code that is customized for the Breakfast Sandwich meal.
There are static data blocks called ```languageStrings```, and a ```data {}``` object containing details and lists.
Carefully modify these green strings within the quotes to define the title, ingredients, and recipe steps.
Be sure to maintain quotes around all strings.  Single or double quotes around strings are both valid (```"``` or ```'```). Ensure all objects ```{key:value}``` and lists ```[item1, item2]``` are properly nested and terminated, as in the starting code sample.

Click **Save** to save the changes to your Lambda function.
[Test](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/tree/master/testing) your function.
